                    <p>I did not include my first game because my smart phone is not stable base on the internet connection. 
                        so I decide to play again but I sacrefice my other apps to stable my internet connection. This game is a rank game,
                        so I do my best to play this game. My experience is first i choose silvana and next in the battle field I play safe and I proceed to the 
                         mid line because we don't have any mage. I did not attack the enemy if they are five but I attack them one by one, so I was have retreat
                         if they are 3 or 4 because i will never kill them if they are so many. I enjoy playing Mobile Legends Bang Bang but as you can see base on
                          my playing skills I am not master well becase I stop playing the ML in 3 years. I play it back because I need to make a blog.
